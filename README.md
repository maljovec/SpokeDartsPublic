# SpokeDarts
SpokeDarts sphere-packing sampling in any dimension. Advancing front sampling from radial lines (spokes) through prior samples.
Two-spokes provides superior blue noise to traditional Maximal Poisson-disk Sampling, avoiding the distribution spike at exactly the sampling radius. Two-spokes is based on Two-radii from Section 3 in the paper "Variable Radii Poisson-Disk Sampling."

## Compiling
The software has been compiled using Xcode on Mac OS X, and cmake and gcc on Linux. The code uses c++11 extensions. If you want to compile it multithreaded, you should consider disabling the use of the Mem_Pool memory managed pool of objects. See source/build/Readme.txt

## Interface
There is a basic interface taking input from standard input. See source/build/Readme.txt for instructions and infile.txt for an example. You can also edit the source code. For examples of how to run the various sampling algorithms and their options, see main.cpp.
